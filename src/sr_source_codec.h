 * ★ Pure-logic adapter. Must not include any furi header.
 *
 * This header defines only the codec shape and the command-buffer contract; it implements no codec.
 * The feed_line and command words for Marauder / GhostESP / Native must wait for a real T0.4
 * dump (or a corresponding VERIFY ✅) before being written; filling them in from memory is forbidden.
 *
 * build_start_cmd / build_stop_cmd:
 *   Write the command into buf and return the bytes written (excluding the trailing NUL).
 *   cap is the total capacity of buf and must fit the command bytes plus the trailing NUL.
 *   On insufficient cap (cap < n+1) it returns 0 and modifies no byte of buf.
